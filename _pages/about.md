Hi, I am first year PhD student at University of Toronto Insitute for Aerospace Studies ([UTIAS](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/)). I am currently supervised by [Prof. Prasanth Nair](http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~pbn/). My areas of interest are Machine Learning methods for Spatio-Temporal data, Computer Vision, and Dyanamics and Controls.
